# hello-world
this is my first repository, feels alright

I'm a bit nervous the gitHub tutorial told me to write about myself.... So yeah, thats what I'm doing now.
I was born and raised in west Philadelphia. As a kid I spent most of my days at the playground. It was all cool.
Sometimes I was even shootin some b-balls. Sadly there have been a couple of unfriendly fellas, who were up to no good.
They terrorised the neighborhood. I got involved in one physical confrontation, which upset my mother.
She decided that it would be better for me to move to my auntie and uncle, who live in Bel Air.
As I looked upon my new kingdom, I realised i was finaly there. Since then I was called "the Prince of Bel Air"
